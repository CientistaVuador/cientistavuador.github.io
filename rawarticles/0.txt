    Texture Format,Size Per Pixel,Notes
    RGB32F,16 Bytes,"
    Overkill for colors, due to padding has the same size as RGBA32F
    "
    RGB16F,8 Bytes,"
    Good for colors, due to padding has the same size as RGBA16F
    "
    RGBA8 RGBE,4 Bytes,"
    Has linear interpolation problems due to exponential values
    "
    RGBA8 RGBM,4 Bytes,"
    Has precision or hue shifting problems due to fixed precision
    "
    DXT5 RGBE,1 Byte,"
    Same as RGBA8 RGBE but compressed in DXT5
    "
    DXT5 RGBM,1 Byte,"
    Same as RGBA8 RGBM but compressed in DXT5
    "
    BC6H,1 Byte,"
    Modern texture compression for HDR Textures, may not work in older hardware
    tools or libraries for compression are more scarce, I recommend using NVIDIA Texture Tools
    "
    DXT1 sRGB * Intensity,0.5 Bytes,"
    Highly agressive compression, may have precision problems.
